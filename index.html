        Install internet Download Manager (IDM) to stop waiting for your downloads.
        You will be truly amazed how fast IDM downloads your files. IDM will also
        repair broken and resume interrupted downloads due to lost connections,
        network problems, computer shutdowns,<BR> or unexpected power outages.

                    Our powerful download engine uses unique algorithms to receive
                    Internet data in a fastest possible way. IDM will accelerate
                    downloads all times because of its innovative dynamic file
                    segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers and
                    accelerators, IDM segments downloaded files dynamically during
                    download process, and it reuses available connections without
                    additional connect and login stages to achieve the best possible
                    acceleration performance. Our engineers have a lot of experience in
                    download acceleration, and we constantly improve this download
                    engine since 1999.
